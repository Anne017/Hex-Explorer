# Hex-Explorer
This is a fairly simple program that might prove useful to anyone unfamiliar with the 16 million or so colours available to them when programming in any computer language that uses the hexadecimal numbers to represent the three colour components of the RGB system.  

Each colour component has 256 different values (from 0 to 255) and can be 'mixed' together to make pretty much any colour in any shade or hue that you could want.  

It was made as a learning exercise for me to see how straightforward or not it was to program in QML and to see what it was like to use the Ubuntu SDK.

Theoretically you can compile the same program for a range of platforms, but it would require removing or changing the Ubuntu specific references. i.e 'UbuntuColors.orange', 'import Ubuntu.Components 1.3', possibly the 'PageHeader' etc.
